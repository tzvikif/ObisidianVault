# Priming

## Priming Protocol
reading for learning is not like reading novel like *Harry Potter* . we need *spoilers* while we are reading.
1. **S**et a timer for 10 minutes
	- the brain forgets unimportant information. *Time restriction* forces the brain to focus on the most important information.
>Parkinsons's law: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

2. **E**stablish the key learning objectives.
	1.  What are the learning objectives?
	2. What topics will you be tested on?
	3. What does the syllabus say that you need to know?
	4. What the teacher says and why is hints will be important?
	5. What do you need to know in order to *apply this knowledge in read life*?
	6. when doubt ask chatGPT
3. **E**xplore the map
	1. scanning the material not deep diving. If you find a section that answer an objective mark that location. for later use.
	2. look for highlights , images, titles etc.
> 80/20 Rule: 20% of the material gives you 80% of what is important.
4. **D**raw the core conecpts
	1. draw main items. how do they *connected and related* to each other? 
		1. are they cause and effect?
		2. bigger part of a whole?
		3. can you order them?
> Pro Tip: try do to it straight from memory!
