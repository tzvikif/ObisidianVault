## Explainability of Graph Neural Network

the benefits of explainability:
- Explainability increased trust in the model
- to know what are the weaknesses and the strengths of the model.

GNN explainer approaches
- edges that contributes the most for the prediction
- important nodes 
- features that are most important

explanation is divided to two branches
* instance-level methods. which features are important. 
	1. [[Gradients/Feature-based]]
	2. [[Perturbation-based]]
	3. [[Decomposition]]
	4. [[Surrogate methods]]
* model-level methods. study which the input graph patterns lead to certain prediction by GNN

 [[GNNExplainer_Concepts]] are presented.
