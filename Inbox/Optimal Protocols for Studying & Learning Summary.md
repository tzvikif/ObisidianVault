## Optimal Protocols for Studying & Learning Summary

- Tell and encourage yourself its important. 
- Try to study at the same time every day.
- Remove distractions.
- Big point is to not forget what you went thru, have a good night sleep after learning; avoid phone just after learning to offset forgeting.
- The best learning happens when its the hardest.
- Exercise for focus: concentrate on one object in your room for 3,5, or 10 minutes.
- One testing after first reading is better then 4 readings.
- Try to think and organise in your mind what you were learning(something like Blue Angels use called chair flying)
- Test right after learning increase your memorisation of the material by 50%.
- AVOID PHONE RIGHT AFTER STUDY TO OFFSET FORGETING(My opinion because we are wired to forget what we see on our phones, social media, news, reels, etc...) 
- If you have or think you have ADHD consult with your doctor first.
- At the end Andrew repeat about how testing testing testing is important 
- Caffeine help a little bit, not much, but enough(My opinion, it helps a lot, but try not on emtpy stomach to avoid upset stomach, nervousness and anxiety.) 
- Cold shower after learning helps but not enough evidence(Medieval tehnique) 
My notes from other sources because dear Andrew didnt told us how to Start which I think is the most important: 
- Nobody can sell you will, discipline and commitment.
- Take caffeine after eating
- Start small, even 5 minutes on Day 1 By Day 7 it goes itself!
- Try same time of the day everyday when you are most productive
- Try setting a timer for 15-25min without distractions.
- Avoid phoneee right after learning
- Try to be off social media until you finish exams
- Dopamine much bigger then from social media and food comes from studying, cold shower and working out.
- Try running before studying (My opinion is that your body gets tired but your brain doesnt so you can sit in one place and study.)
- Cold shower helps My last advice, studying is hard, but it doesnt kill you, try to be a mazohist for couple days with structured work out, cold shower and studying, tell yourself(like Arnold) I am going to die until I do it. So try to kill yourself with these three things. What you will realise is no matter how much you try, its not gonna kill you, the relief after pain from this 3 things is bigger then just sitting and doing nothing with no pain at all. Happyness and life purpose is love and peace and it comes from pain and experience, now that I solve you that too, you dont have to think about that.
