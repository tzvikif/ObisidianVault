# Revision

before the revision session:
## 1. Testing Yourself On the Information

Test yourself on 20-30 questions and try really hard to remember anything you can about them, *spending at least 15-30 seconds* on each question.

## 2. Re-understand the information

Once you answer 2-3 questions(maybe using flash cards)  on the same concept, then go check the answer from your textbook or ppt to *re-understand* it.
1. Identify the right answer and its meaning is within the topic.
2. Categorize or group this information in your head.
3. Relate the information to the topic. How? **compare that concept to related concept** in the same topic or different topic. 
	- what are the differences? 
	- when to use which? 
	- How do they relate?


### Bonus
the author uses *mindmap*.
in case of a wrong answer:
the author relate steps no.2 , no.3 to the *mindmap* and changing it if necessary on going partially over it.
