# Central limit theorem

take **any**  distribution of a population. sample from it with sample size $N$ . take the *mean* of the sample. 
repeat that. at the end the distribution will  approximate Normal distribution. 
As $N$ gets bigger the approximation will be better.

### the mean of the population
Usually we don't know the $\mu$ of the population
