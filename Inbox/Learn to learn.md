[How I Study SMARTER, Not HARDER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMhhaAQK1NQ)

1. From top students - set time just for studying with no distractions - break up study sessions - stay consistent with study times, helps with body rhythm 
2. Testing your self - helps to retain and learn info - ask yourself questions: what can you remember right after studying? - active recall, don’t just reread material
3. Teach your peers
4. Gap effects - take periodic pauses 5-30secs, let your hippocampus learn
5. Motivation - their success would affect their lives - aspirational

## Active Recall
2. Read or watch a single bit of information you need to know 
3. Reformulate that information in your own words 
	1. Just do it in your mind
	2. Say it out loud 
	3. Write it out, by hand
