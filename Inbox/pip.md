## To install a Python package directly from GitHub
### Requirements

For any of these methods to work, the GitHub repository needs to have a proper Python package structure with a [[setup.py]] file or a [[pyproject.toml]] file.
### GitHub repository URL
``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
### For a specific branch, tag, or commit
``` bash
# For a specific branch
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@branch_name

# For a specific tag
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@v1.0.0

# For a specific commit
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git@8c48289
```

### Using pip with SSH (if you have SSH access to the repository)
``` bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/username/repository.git
```

### Cloning and installing locally.
If you need to examine or modify the code before installing
``` bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Change to the repository directory
cd repository

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag installs in "editable" mode, so changes to the source code will be reflected in your environment without reinstalling.
