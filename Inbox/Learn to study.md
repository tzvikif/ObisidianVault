[How I Study SMARTER, Not HARDER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMhhaAQK1NQ)

1. From top students - set time just for studying with no distractions - break up study sessions - stay consistent with study times, helps with body rhythm 
2. Testing your self - helps to retain and learn info - ask yourself questions: what can you remember right after studying? - active recall, don’t just reread material
3. Teach your peers
4. Gap effects - take periodic pauses 5-30secs, let your hippocampus learn
5. Motivation - their success would affect their lives - aspirational

## Active Recall

3. Reformulate that information in your own words 
	1. Just do it in your mind
	2. Say it out loud 
	3. Write it out, by hand
