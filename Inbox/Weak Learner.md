# Weak Learner

A weak learner is a model that performs only **slightly better than random guessing** (like a simple decision tree with few splits). The key insight of ensemble methods is that combining many weak learners in the right way can create a strong overall model.

### Analogy
It's like building a team of specialists rather than generalists. Each weak learner becomes an expert at handling a specific subset of cases that previous models struggled with, rather than trying to be good at everything.

### Why Weak Learners Work Better
Using weak learners actually helps prevent overfitting. If each model in the ensemble were too complex or powerful, the ensemble might end up fitting the training data too closely and perform poorly on new data.
## My Questions
- Q: which type of models use *weak learners* and why is it useful?
