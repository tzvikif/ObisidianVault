i need to further investigate the GNNExplainer output. mainly the nodes.
and maybe using Neo4j. 
in order to be concise add index to every node according to the indices that handed over to pytorch geometric.

for tomorrow Papers & Stuff 
i want to go over [[Graph Attention Networks]] which uses attention of graph. that paper is based on [[Attention Is All You Need]]
an improvement of  [[Graph Attention Networks]] is [[HOW ATTENTIVE ARE GRAPH ATTENTION NETWORKS(GATv2)]]
