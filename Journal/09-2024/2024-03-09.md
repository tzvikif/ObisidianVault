trying to figure out **GNNExplainer** output.

```python
sub_graph = explanation.get_explanation_subgraph().cpu()
```
sub_graph has just a single node when using on Radcom dataset.

when i used on Cora dataset i got multiple nodes. 
but even then the image didn't make much sense. some edges where **out edges**

trying to understand more from [[Explainability of Graph Neural Network ]]
