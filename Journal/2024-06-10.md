- figure out if the "islands" in the GNNExplainer are created because a bad initialization.
- i gained the data  what Udi requested. Namely changing the most important features and observed the output. how to proceed?
	- take lower importance features and compare.
	- take probabilities after *softmax* instead of the class label.
