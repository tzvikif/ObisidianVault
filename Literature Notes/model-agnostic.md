## model-agnostic



- Independence from Model Type
- Model agnostic methods work with any type of machine learning model, such as decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, and ensemble methods.
- Model agnostic techniques are often used after a model has been trained. They analyze the model's predictions and provide explanations or insights without modifying the model itself.
- **Post-Hoc Analysis**: analyze model prediction without changing the model itself.
### example
- Permutation Feature Importance
- Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Surrogate Models
